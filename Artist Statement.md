Typography Project
Haiku Herupā
 

For my final project, I had no idea what I wanted to do. The day when we got the guest lectures, I got inspired by their work, especially from Rodrigo Velasco’s presentation on 
‘Live Coding’. I wanted to do something with that, but after doing some research I found out that it will be hard to show my work since live coding is like a performance done live, in real-time. Finally, I decided to do something different, and went back and looked at the previous guest speaker’s work, Sally Qianxun Chen’s work. I really liked her work where words were growing like a branch of a tree, how she used machine learning to create that work. That’s how the idea of my project came to light. Haiku is a Japenese style of poetry, that doesn’t rhyme. So I decided to create a tool that can help people come up with words that can be used that describes the words they are looking for. By using machine learning code “Word2Vec”, and a bank of words “MuseData”, I created a site that does exactly that. 

Word2Vec is a machine learning algorithm that processes text and words. By using the code and combining it with a word data bank MuseData, I was able to generate words that describes in detail the characteristics of the chosen word. This is how the users of this tool will be able to create a unique Haiku.
